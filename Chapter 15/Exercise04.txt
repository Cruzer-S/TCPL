Answer: (a)
Output if DEBUG is defined:
Value of i: 1
Value of j: 2
Value of k: 3
Value of i + j: 3
Value of 2 * i + j - k: 1

(b) Output if DEBIG is not defined: 

(c) because PRINT_DEBUG parameterized-macro is only defined when simple-macro DEBUG is defined.
when DEBUG isn't defined before including header file "debug.h", invoking PRINT_DEBUG is translated to white-space.

(d) the order of preprocessor affect the PRINT_DEBUG. just simply convert #include "debug.h" to contents of debug.h becomes clearer.
