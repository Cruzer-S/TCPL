Answer:
(a) because all identifiers begin with an underscore are reserved for the standard libarary. therefore programmer can avoid to use the name of macro such as "_UPPER".

(b) _ctype contain code table of specific environment.
Horizontal tab: 40
Space bar: 32
"A": 65
^: 0

(c) There's three advantages using array.
1. There's no function call. Additional machine code doesn't insert.
2. Increasing code reusability. Each ctype header function only call the _ctype function.
3. Hash table faster than Linear searching. To use array can make performance more faster rather than searching all characters using function call.
