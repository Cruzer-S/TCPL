Answer:
(a)
long long_max(long x, long y)
{
	return x > y ? x : y;
}

(b)
if GENERIC_MAX(unsigned long) is invoked, preprocessor expands like this:
unsigned long unsigned long_max(unsigned long x, unsigned long y)
{
	return x > y ? x : y;
}

the name of function is long_max not a unsigned long max.
moreover, there's no such type unsigned long unsigned.

(c) To use typedef is the way to solve this problem:
typedef unsigned long ulong.
ulong is the token that are not seperated white-space.
