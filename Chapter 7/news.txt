A number of senior figures in the Republican party have said they will support impeaching President Donald Trump over his role in last week's storming of Congress.

The House of Representatives' third most senior Republican, Liz Cheney, said she would support impeachment.

A vote is likely to be held in the House on Wednesday.

In his first comments since the riot, Mr Trump took no responsibility for the violence which resulted in five deaths.

Democrats accuse Mr Trump of inciting his supporters to storm the Capitol building at a speech before the riot, and are expected to push for a vote to impeach - a formal charge - the president with inciting insurrection.
