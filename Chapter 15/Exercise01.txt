Answer: 
(a) 1. grouping related functions and variables into a single file helps clarify the structure of the program. 
    2. each source file can be compiled separately which can be save a huge time.
    3. function are more easily reused in other programs when grouped in separate source file.
	(1 - 3) in section 15.1
	4. to divide large source file into small single source file can makes it easy to find error when debug program.
	5. hiding information helps to focus on the essence. 
	   they don't need to know what happens to source file when calling a function that declared in the header file.
	(4 - 5) in my opinion

(b) 1. incorrect dependency structure makes program maintenance more difficult. 
       therefore we have to spend a lot of time not only just type source code to make program but also how to divide source file.
	2. excessively scattered source file makes other to difficult to read the code and understand structure.
	   make it worse, they even have to find the source code where main function was included.
